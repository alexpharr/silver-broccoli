The client should be informed about what they are investing in, as well as which SEO services are important for their specific industry, business type, and goals.

What exactly sets the business apart and makes it unique?

Before starting, it is essential to address a few key questions: What problem is the client facing? How do they plan to solve this problem, and with what resources? What specific goals do they aim to achieve?

The client typically has a deep understanding of their average customer and can anticipate how these customers will interact with their website and content. Therefore, defining the customer persona first is crucial to ensure that both the client and the SEO expert are aligned.

The client often knows which types of customers and products generate the most revenue for their business. This knowledge is vital in determining which types of content and areas of SEO should be prioritized.

Understanding this information is critical for developing an effective keyword strategy. Clients can significantly contribute during the keyword research phase because they are familiar with the specific terminology used in their industry and the language their customers use to find their products.

The SEO expert must clearly define the type of service they are providing. If they are offering only consultation or strategy development, it is important to discuss the resources the client has available to implement the SEO processes.

SEO professionals and clients should establish a clear communication plan. For instance, does the client have an in-house development team? What does the sign-off process look like? Do stakeholders wish to be involved in the decision-making process?

SEO professionals and clients should collaborate closely to identify competitors. While the client may have a thorough understanding of their industry and main competitors, they might overlook smaller competitor websites that are targeting the same organic keywords. This is where the expertise of the SEO professional can provide valuable insights.
